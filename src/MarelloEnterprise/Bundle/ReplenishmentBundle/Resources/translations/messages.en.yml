                    tooltip: |
                        Represents a percentage on how much of the available inventory is being distributed to destinations based on the origins.
                        So if the origin has 100 available and 50% is given as percentage, this means that only 50 products are being distributedto the destinations (100/100*50)=50.
                        If there are more origins given, let's say  3 origins with individual quantities of 100, 50 and 150 which  totals to 300 the 50% is being taken of each individual origin.
                        Meaning the first origin should ship 50, the second origin should ship 25 and the third origin should ship 75.
                        This approach will be used for each individual product
