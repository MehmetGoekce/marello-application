Marello Application
==============================

Marello is an Open Source ERP for Commerce tool.

This document contains information on how to download, install, and start
using Marello.

## Requirements

Marello is a Symfony 2 based application with the following requirements:

* PHP 7.0 or above with command line interface
* PHP Extensions
    * GD
    * Mcrypt
    * JSON
    * ctype
    * Tokenizer
    * SimpleXML
    * PCRE
    * ICU
* MySQL 5.1 or above
* PostgreSQL 9.1 or above

## Installation instructions

As both Symfony and Marello use [Composer][2] to manage their dependencies, this is the recommended way to install Marello.

- Clone Marello application repository:

```bash
git clone -b x.y.z https://github.com/marellocommerce/marello-application.git
```

where x.y.z is the latest [release tag](https://github.com/marellocommerce/marello-application/releases) or use the latest master:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/marellocommerce/marello-application.git
```

- Install [Composer][3] globally following the official Composer [installation documentation][4]

- Make sure that you have [NodeJS][4] installed

- Install Marello dependencies with composer. If installation process seems too slow you can use `--prefer-dist` option. Go to marello-application folder and run composer installation:

```bash
composer install --prefer-dist --no-dev
```

- Create the database with the name specified on previous step (default name is "marello_application").

- On some systems it might be necessary to temporarily increase memory_limit setting to 1 GB in php.ini configuration file for the duration of the installation process:
```bash
memory_limit=1024M
```

**Note:** After the installation is finished the memory_limit configuration can be changed back to the recommended value (512 MB or more).

- Install application and admin user with Installation Wizard by opening install.php in the browser or from CLI:

```bash  
php app/console oro:install --env prod
```

**Note** If the installation process times out, add the `--timeout=0` argument to the oro:install command.

- Enable WebSockets messaging

```bash
php app/console clank:server --env prod
```

- Configure crontab or scheduled tasks execution to run the command below every minute:

```bash
php app/console oro:cron --env prod

```
- Launch the message queue processing:
```bash
php app/console oro:message-queue:consume --env=prod
```
**Note** We do recommend to use a supervisor for running the ``oro:message-queue:consume`` command. This will make sure that the command and
the consumer will run all the time. This has become important for every Oro Platform based application since a lot of background tasks depend
 on the consumer to run. For more information about configuration and what supervisor can do for you can either through the [Oro(CRM) docs][6] or the
 [site of Supervisord][7].
 
**Note:** ``app/console`` is a path from project root folder. Please make sure you are using full path for crontab configuration or if you running console command from other location.

## Installation notes

Installed PHP Accelerators must be compatible with Symfony and Doctrine (support DOCBLOCKs)

Note that the port used in Websocket must be open in firewall for outgoing/incoming connections

Using MySQL 5.6 on HDD is potentially risky because of performance issues

Recommended configuration for this case:

    innodb_file_per_table = 0

And ensure that timeout has default value

    wait_timeout = 28800

See [Optimizing InnoDB Disk I/O][3] for more

## PostgreSQL installation notes

You need to load `uuid-ossp` extension for proper doctrine's `guid` type handling.
Log into database and run sql query:

```
CREATE EXTENSION "uuid-ossp";
```

## Web Server Configuration

The Marello application is based on the Symfony standard application so web server configuration recommendations are the [same][5].

## Package Manager Configuration

Github OAuth token should be configured in package manager settings
